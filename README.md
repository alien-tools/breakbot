# Break-bot

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot), designed to help developpers measure the impacct of the updates of their libraries on their clients.
Once installed on a repository, it will publish a report as a check on each new pull request. This report contains a list of the breaking changes created by this PR, compared to the base branch, and a list of the clients impacted for each PR.

## How to start breakbot

### Locally
This doesn't work right now unless you change the adress both in the configuration variables (the .env file) and on the app configuration page.
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the app
npm run build

# Run the bot
npm start
```

### Locally with heroku
Not recommended since there is an issue with accessing configuration variables (see [code details](DOC_BREAKBOT.md), the last part, Hosting, for more details).
Uses the Procfile to start, instead of the package.json
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the app
npm run build

# Run the bot
heroku local web
```

### Deploy on heroku
For more informations, see the last part **Hosting: Heroku**
```sh
# To push from main
git push heroku main

# To push from a different branch than main
git push heroku testbranch:main
```

## Configure Breakbot
